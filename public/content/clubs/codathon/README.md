> “Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.”

Codathon was that piece of the platform that provided an experience to the students to identify their strengths and weaknesses. 

A coding marathon organized by the HACK CLUB ITER served the same.
 A 2-week long learning marathon was indeed a great kickstart for respective domains. 

- 07 days of Web Development Challenge 
- 07 days of Python Development Challenge. 


## Aim
With the advancing technologies, it is very much required for each student to stay up-to-date about the same.

The Codathon provided the much-needed push to start the journey of Web Development and Python Development. 

Starting from the very basics the students experienced a recap and indeed a new start into the particular arenas. 

## Event summary
Resources are one of the important requirements while learning anything new.

To have an easy ongoing, the Resources were compiled into a GitHub repository, wherefrom the participants got the road map of how to begin and learn. 

After the Resources were provided, tests were conducted at the end of each day to keep a track of every individual student's progress. 

As it was a  week-long program, a final weekend progress test was conducted which marked the overall progress of the students.

The winners of the particular events were judged based on the progress they made in each challenge. 

The 7 days of web dev comprised the learnings starting from the very basics that included Html, CSS, Javascript. We devoted 2 days for each of the stacks to get covered. 

Along with the learning in progress, simultaneous tests were also conducted to mark the understanding and progress of the students.

Unlike the python challenge, the students had to submit a project using the basics that they learned from the event. 

The winners were decided by looking at the amount of usage of each of the stacks they got to learn and how they deployed the same into their final projects. 
Python is one of the newest and emerging languages, is vast in itself. So, we started from the very basics.

The python development challenge, made students get familiar with syntaxes, their usage, their implementation, and the very different aspects of its usage. 

The challenge haunted out with the file handling part of python, which is again one of the most important when one is learning python for data analysis. 

## Conclusion

The overwhelming participation and enthusiasm of students made this event a grand success. 

There were over 200 registrations with 100+ participants accompanying us till the end, completing and competing upon every task that was assigned with utmost interest and zeal.

For the 07 days of web development challenge nearly 100 projects were seen to have been flooding, some were of very high quality, and some although beginner level was quite innovative.

We are very thankful to all the participants who made their learning path with us till the end and we hope that they would have found this fun-learning event quite helpful.
