#  ML with python for beginners
<br/>

Hello myself Siddhi Satish Bhanushali,ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ I am one of the hack club leads.Being selected as a lead, I was so excited to start something new.As soon as I got selected, I started making a good team. And after that we all started thinking about how to start. Soon we came up with an idea and we decided to conduct a hands on workshop on Machine Learning with python for beginners. 

We started marketing about the session,we even took registrations through our website and we got a great response with 100+ registrations. The team got a boost due to this.

So,everything was planned well and we were very excited to host our first session.
We planned the session on 15th August Sunday at 11 am. Our hosts  started of really well,they introduced our speaker and gave some instructions for the session.

The session started with some 60 participants and the session went on for 2 hours where 
people learnt the basics of python and then gradually went on learning some machine learning algorithms.

People cleared their doubts and the session was going on well. At the end of the session we hosted a kahoot quiz based on the session and it was just amazing.Overall,the first event was a huge success ,we got a great feedback for this session and I feel very happy that hack club gave me this chance. Thank you.
